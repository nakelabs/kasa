```
This interactive script guides you through testing all features.

### Manual Testing

1. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Run Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   python test_user_features.py
   ```

3. **Interactive USSD Testing**:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_ussd_simulator.py
   ```

4. **Upload Sample CSV**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/upload-users" \
        -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
        -F "file=@sample_users.csv"
   ```

## 📱 USSD Flow Examples

### New User Registration
```
*123# → Welcome to KASA
     → 2. Register User
     → "Enter your full name:"
     → [User enters: John Doe]
     → "Hello John Doe! Enter your location/area:"
     → [User enters: Westlands]
     → "Confirm registration: Name: John Doe, Location: Westlands"
     → 1. Confirm → "Registration successful!"
```

### Emergency Alert with Location Integration
```
*123# → 1. Emergency Alert
     → 1. Fire Emergency
     → 1. Confirm
     → "Fire Emergency alert sent! 5 local users notified. Reference: EMR-12345678"
```

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Features

### Enhanced Emergency Alerts
- Emergency alerts now check if the user is registered
- If registered, alerts include user's location information
- Other users in the same location are automatically notified
- More detailed location context in emergency reports

### Location Detection Integration

- Now enhanced with user-provided location data
- Emergency responders get both technical location and user-provided area

### SMS Alert System Integration
- All existing SMS functionality preserved
- Enhanced with location-based targeting
- Bulk alerts can now target specific locations

## 🎮 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bulk User Registration
1. Admin uploads `sample_users.csv` via `/upload-users`
2. 10 users are registered across different locations
3. System confirms import with detailed statistics

### Scenario 2: USSD Registration
1. New user dials `*123#` and selects "Register User"
2. Completes multi-step registration process

### Scenario 3: Location-based Emergency Response
1. Registered user in "Westlands" reports fire emergency via USSD
2. System sends SMS to all other users in "Westlands"
3. Emergency services receive detailed location information

### Scenario 4: Location Alert Broadcasting
